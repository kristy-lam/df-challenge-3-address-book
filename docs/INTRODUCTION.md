# Introduction - DF Corp Address Book Application

## Purpose and Benefits

This application is to help address book users to -
1. add contacts;
2. search for contacts by their name, phone number or email address;
3. edit contacts;
4. delete contacts; and
5. view all contacts.

The application provides a handy way for users to view and manage their contacts. The benefits brought by the application are summarised below:

For the users:
- The contacts are saved in the address book which can be accessed easily. There is no need to write down phone numbers in a notebook anymore.
- Inputs including phone numbers and email addresses are validated, which can prevent typos or careless mistakes.
- There is a search function where the users can view all contacts containing the same information (e.g. email addresses with the same domain name), which is very handy.
- The contacts can be edited when there is any change.
- Duplicating contacts with the same phone number or email address as any contact already stored in the address book would not be allowed, which keeps the contact information concise and tody.
- All contacts can be viewed at the same time.
- The user can reset the address book and delete all contacts easily, but will be prompted to confirm as a safety net.

For business:
- The introduction of the application shows that DF Corp is progressive and striving to improve customer service and experience, which will enhance client's image.
- The application's features can be customised and added in the future based on customers' needs.
- The introduction of the application hopefully becomes an incentive for potential customers to engage the services provided by DF Corp.
